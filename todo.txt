FIXES:
    1. Minimum time gap check is broken. The minimum time gap gets added when only the time difference is specified.
    2. Task detals display format. Specifically the line breaks between tasks.

ADDITIONS:
    1. Try catch wrapping were possible errors might occur and dispatch error message to user when catched.
    2. Testing for specific individual components
    3. Add storage of schedule when the application is stopped and retrieval of the stored schedule when it is started.
    4. Testing without whatsapp. A script that automates dummy requests to api disguised as Twilio requests.
